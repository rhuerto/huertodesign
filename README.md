Online portfolio of Rod Huerto to showcase and display past projects, experience and skills I've picked up during my years as a front-end, interactive, manager, designer and developer.

**GatsbyJS**
> I used the GatsbyJS framework to help build this static website using easy templating, code optimizations but most importantly the access to use graphQL for data queries.

**ReactJS**
> Using React to build this static website helped build components that pieces everything together rather than using includes and different templates and layouts.

**Material-UI**
> I was able to utilize Material-UI for quick interface builds using pre-built components. This also helps with speed and consistent design for the user interface.
