Online portfolio of Rod Huerto to showcase and display past projects, experience and skills I've picked up during my years as a front-end, interactive, manager, designer and developer.


  **GatsbyJS**

    ```shell
    I used the GatsbyJS framework to help build this static website using easy templating, code optimizations but most importantly the access to use graphQL for data queries.
    ```

  **ReactJS**
    ```shell
    Using React to build this static website helped build components that pieces everything together rather than using includes and different templates and layouts.
    ```

  **Material-UI**
    ```shell
    I was able to utilize Material-UI for quick interface builds using pre-built components. This also helps with speed and consistent design for the user interface.
    ```
