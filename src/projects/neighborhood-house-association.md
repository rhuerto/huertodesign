## Design and Development

<p>Intranet design, portal login page, and multiple campaigns and landing pages for non-profit agency.</p>

<p class="last-line">Most of the designs and development work are within the company intranet. Since this was a non-profit company most of the landing pages and campaigns were not public facing and mostly used for internal purposes.</p>
