## Concept Designs

<p>This was a demo that I built for Cox Communications to display what kind of advertisements we can design and run on the San Diego Union-Tribune website.</p>

<p class="last-line">The demo link below is all screenshot image examples of the designs we offered. Most advertisements were rich media and interactive.</p>
