## From Graphic Designer to Interactive Manager

<p>From 2008 to 2016 I was privileged and blessed to be part of a organization that helped me grow, learn and become the designer and developer I am today. I started off as a graphic and web designer creating banner ads and landing pages to managing lead of the Interactive Department composed of front-end and back-end developers. Showcased below is just a fraction of my contributions to the organization, from full large scale redesign of the main website to special projects and banner ad creations.</p>

<p class="last-line">Although the website has now been through multiple transitions and designs, I wanted to showcase the work that I did when I was the manager of the Interactive design and development team and how I lead the design and development working with front-end, back-end and system admin teams to create and build this website.</p>

## Full Redesign and Development

<p>In 2015 I was tasked to do a full overhaul of sandiegouniontribune.com. Completed redesign using the latest framework and technology back then. Fully integrated with a CMS called Ellington, which is a news publishing specialized CMS.</p>

## Responsive and Flexible

<p>The site was built ensuring all device compatibility. This was a team effort so I implemented many processes to ensure the project stayed on schedule and within the budget.</p>

## App Design and Development

<p>Other projects include one-off app design and mobile projects, ensuring all designs were fully responsive across the board. This was vital to ensure the CMS can communicate to all platforms.</p>

<p class="last-line">Discover San Diego is a travel and lifestyle app for the iOS and Android platforms that I designed and prototyped. Although I didn't build and code the app (worked with 3rd party vendor to develop) I designed the UI and UX.</p>

## Newsletters

<p>Samples of a couple of email campaigns for a daily newsletter tied to the CMS powering the main website and Discover SD entertainment promotion newsletter. No curation was needed and newsrooms simply pushed out newsletters with a push of a button.</p>

<p>Discover SD, the entertainment brand of the Union-Tribune had multiple weekly emails go out promoting events and advertisement pieces.</p>

## UT-TV

<p>In 2012-2016 The San Diego Union-Tribune launched a television station called UT-TV. The tv station aired live on broadcast tv and also on the SDUT website. I had the privilege to lead all digital designs and interface builds. It was my role to ensure the tv page was designed tastefully and optimized since we had a built in video player running advertisements.</p>

## UT Elections Coverage

<p>During my tenure at the UT I always had a hand in the Elections coverage every year. Showcased below are some images of the work I did between multiple platforms. I would design and develop interfaces for the website, mobile and television graphics that UT-TV would use during live coverage. Complete with real time results feed via API and data from the Registrar of Voters.</p>

## Comin-Con San Diego

<p>Every year I had the opportunity to design and develop landing pages and news section coverage of Comic-Con International. We always had special coverage and designs each year and I would work with the newsroom and marketing teams to create special coverage to match the theme of each event.</p>

## Junior Seau - Through The Years

<p>This was a special one off project we created that went hand-in-hand with a special edition print product that was bundled with the Sunday edition of the newspaper. I created an interactive, dynamic and highly art directed piece for Junior Seau. With each click of the year the images and article would change.</p>

## Special Projects

<p>Through out my career at The San Diego Union-Tribune I created multiple projects for advertising, marketing and the newsroom. Most of these projects were special in their own right and promoted may digital products or just giving users a unique story telling experience.</p>

<p class="last-line">While many of these projects are no longer live and online, I wanted to showcase just a few screen shots of the kind of special projects I was involved in.</p>
